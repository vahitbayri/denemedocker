## Scoold - Stack Overflow in a JAR

[![Join the chat at https://gitter.im/Erudika/scoold](https://badges.gitter.im/Erudika/scoold.svg)](https://gitter.im/Erudika/scoold?utm_source=badge&utm_medium=badge&utm_campaign=pr-badge&utm_content=badge)

**Scoold** is a Q&A/knowledge base platform written in Java. The project was created back in 2008, released in 2012 as
social network for schools inspired by Stack Overflow. In 2017 it was refactored, repackaged and open-sourced.

Scoold can run anywhere - Heroku, DigitalOcean, AWS, Azure or any VPS hosting provider. It's lightweight (~4000 LOC),
the backend is handled by a separate service called [Para](https://github.com/Erudika/para). Scoold does not require a
database, and the controller logic is really simple because all the heavy lifting is delegated to Para.
This makes the code easy to read and can be learned quickly by junior developers.

**Scoold Pro**, the paid version of Scoold, has premium features which make it the perfect knowledge sharing platform for
your company or team.

**This project is fully funded and supported by [Erudika](https://erudika.com) - an independent, bootstrapped company.**

## [Buy Scoold Pro 299 EUR](https://paraio.com/scoold-pro)

## Live Demo

*The demo is deployed on a free dyno and it might take a minute to wake up.*
### [Live demo on Heroku](https://live.scoold.com)

### Quick Start with a managed Para backend (easier)

[JDK 1.8 or higher](https://openjdk.java.net/) is required to build and run the project. All major operating systems are supported.

0. First, you *need* to create a developer app with [Facebook](https://developers.facebook.com),
[Google](https://console.developers.google.com) or **any other identity provider** that you wish to use.
This isn't necessary if you're planning to login with LDAP, SAML or with a email and password.
Save the obtained API keys in `application.conf`, as shown below.

> **Important:** Authorized redirect URLs for Google and Facebook should look like this: `https://{your_scoold_host}`,
`https://{your_scoold_host}/signin`. For all the other identity providers you must whitelist the Para host with the
appropriate authentication endpoint. For example, for GitHub, the redirect URL could be: `https://paraio.com/github_auth`.

1. Create a new app on [ParaIO.com](https://paraio.com) and copy your access keys to a file
2. Click one of the quick deploy buttons **or** skip to step 3 for local deployment:

<a href="https://heroku.com/deploy?template=https://github.com/Erudika/scoold" title="Deploy to Heroku">
	<img src="https://www.herokucdn.com/deploy/button.svg" alt="btn">
</a>
<a href="https://lightsail.aws.amazon.com/ls/webapp/create/instance" title="Deploy to Lightsail">
	<img src="https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/com.scoold.files/awsdeploy.svg" height="32" alt="deploy to aws button">

<a href="https://deploy.azure.com/?repository=https://github.com/Erudika/scoold" title="Install on Azure">
	<img src="https://azuredeploy.net/deploybutton.svg" height="32" alt="btn">
</a>

3. Create Scoold's configuration file named `application.conf` and add the following properties to it:
```ini
para.app_name = "Scoold"
para.access_key = "app:your_para_app"
para.secret_key = "your_app_secret_key"
para.endpoint = "https://paraio.com"
```
4. Start Scoold with `java -jar -Dconfig.file=./application.conf scoold.jar`
5. Open `http://localhost:8000` in your browser

### Quick Start with a self-hosted Para backend (harder)

**Note: The Para backend server is deployed separately and is required for Scoold to run.**

1. [run Para locally on port 8080](https://paraio.org/docs/#001-intro) and initialize it with `GET localhost:8080/v1/_setup`
2. Save the access keys for the root Para app somewhere safe, you'll need them to configure Para CLI tool below
3. Create a new directory for Scoold containing a file called `application.conf` and paste in the example configuration below.
4. Create a new Para app called `scoold` using [Para CLI](https://github.com/Erudika/para-cli) tool:
```sh
# !!! You will need to have Node.js and NPM installed beforehand.
$ npm install -g para-cli
# run setup and enter the keys for the root app and endpoint 'http://localhost:8080'
$ para-cli setup
$ para-cli ping
$ para-cli new-app "scoold" --name "Scoold"
```
5. Save the keys inside Scoold's `application.conf` like this:
```ini
para.access_key = "app:scoold"
para.secret_key = "..."
```
6. Start Scoold with `java -jar -Dconfig.file=./application.conf scoold.jar` and keep an eye on the log for any error messages
7. Open `http://localhost:8000` in your browser


> **Important: Do not use the same `application.conf` file for both Para and Scoold!**
Keep the two applications in separate directories, each with its own configuration file.
All settings shown below are meant to be kept in the Scoold config file.
If you want to sign up with an email and password, SMTP settings must be configured before deploying Scoold to production.

[Read the Para docs](https://paraio.org/docs) for details on how to run and configure your Scoold backend.

### Hardware requirements

Scoold and Para can both be hosted on the same machine, provided it has at least 3 GB of RAM. Scoold requires:
- at least 500 MB RAM
- 1 vCPU or more
- 10 GB disk space or more (primarily for logs and storing images)

Para requires:
- at least 1 GB RAM
- 1 vCPU (2 are recommended)
- 10 GB disk space or more (unless the database is stored on the same machine)

JVM parameters: e.g. `java -jar -Xms600m -Xmx600m scoold.jar`

## Configuration

> **Important:** Create a separate app for Scoold, instead of using `app:para`, when hosting your own instance of Para.

The most important settings are `para.endpoint` - the URL of the Para server, as well as,
`para.access_key` and `para.secret_key`. Connection to a Para server *is required* for Scoold to run.

Copy the Scoold example configuration below to your **`application.conf`** and edit it if necessary:
```ini
### Minimal configuration ###
# the name of the application
para.app_name = "Scoold"
# the port for Scoold
para.port = 8000
# change this to "production" later
para.env = "development"
# the public-facing URL where Scoold is hosted
para.host_url = "http://localhost:8000"
# the URL of Para - can also be "https://paraio.com"
para.endpoint = "http://localhost:8080"
# access key for your Para app
para.access_key = "app:scoold"
# secret key for your Para app
para.secret_key = ""
# the email or identifier of the admin user - check Para user object
para.admins = "admin@domain.com"
##############################

####### Authentication #######
# enable or disable email and password authentication
para.password_auth_enabled = true
# Session cookie name
para.auth_cookie = "scoold-auth"
# Facebook - create your own Facebook app first!
para.fb_app_id = "123456789"
# Google - create your own Google app first!
para.google_client_id = "123-abcd.apps.googleusercontent.com"
###############################

### Misc. ###
# if false, commenting is allowed after 100+ reputation
para.new_users_can_comment = true
# if true, posts by new users require approval from moderator
para.posts_need_approval = false
# reputation needed for posts to be auto-approved
para.posts_rep_threshold = 100
# needed for geolocation filtering of posts
para.gmaps_api_key = ""
# Enable/disable near me feature (geolocation)
para.nearme_feature_enabled = false
# GA code
para.google_analytics_id = "UA-123456-7"
# enables syntax highlighting in posts
para.code_highlighting_enabled = true
# If true, the default space will be accessible by everyone
para.is_default_space_public = true
# If true, users can change their profile pictures
para.avatar_edits_enabled = true
# If true, users can change their names
para.name_edits_enabled = true
# Enable/disable webhooks support
para.webhooks_enabled = true
# Enable/disable wiki style answers
para.wiki_answers_enabled = true
# Comment limits
para.max_comments_per_id = 1000
para.max_comment_length = 255
# Post body limit (characters)
para.max_post_length = 20000
# Sets the default tag for new questions
para.default_question_tag = "question"
# Enable/disable numeric pagination (< 1 2 3...N >)
para.numeric_pagination_enabled = false
# Selects the default language to load on startup, defaults to 'en'
para.default_language_code = ""
```

On startup, Scoold will try to connect to Para 10 times, with a 10 second interval between retries. After that it will
fail and the settings will not be persisted. If you set the maximum number of retries to `-1` there will be an infinite
number of attempts to connect to Para. These parameters are controlled by:

```
para.connection_retries_max = 10
para.connection_retry_interval_sec = 10
```

## Docker

Tagged Docker images for Scoold are located at `erudikaltd/scoold` on Docker Hub.
First, have your Scoold `application.conf` configuration file ready in the current directory and run this command:

```
$ docker run -ti -p 8000:8000 --rm -v $(pwd)/application.conf:/scoold/application.conf \
  -e JAVA_OPTS="-Dconfig.file=/scoold/application.conf" erudikaltd/scoold
```

**Environment variables**

`JAVA_OPTS` - Java system properties, e.g. `-Dpara.port=8000`
`BOOT_SLEEP` - Startup delay, in seconds

**Docker Compose**

You can start the whole stack, Para + Scoold, with a single command using `docker-compose`.
First, create a new directory and copy `docker-compose.yml` to it from this repository. Create these 4 files:

1. `para.env` - containing environment variables for Para, like `JAVA_OPTS`
2. `scoold.env` - containing environment variables for Scoold, like `JAVA_OPTS`
3. `para-application.conf` - containing the Para configuration (see example below)
4. `scoold-application.conf` - containing the Scoold configuration (see example above)

An example `para.env` file:
```sh
JAVA_OPTS="-Dconfig.file=/para/application.conf -Dloader.path=lib"
```
Example for `scoold.env`:
```sh
JAVA_OPTS=-Dconfig.file=/scoold/application.conf
BOOT_SLEEP=6
```
Example for `para-application.conf`:
```ini
para.env = "production"
para.dao = "H2DAO"
```

Then you can start both Scoold and Para with Docker Compose like so:
```
$ docker-compose up
```
Follow the quick start guide above to initialize Para and create a new app for Scoold. Once you have the access keys
for that app, update `scoold-application.conf` with those and restart the Para + Scoold Docker stack.

## Kubernetes

There's a Helm chart inside the `helm/` folder. First edit `helm/scoold/values.yaml` and then you can deploy Scoold to
Kubernetes with a single command:

```
cd helm; helm install ./scoold
```

For more info, read the README at `helm/README.md`.

## Docker registry for Scoold Pro images

If you purchase Scoold Pro you can get access to the private Docker registry hosted on the AWS Elastic Container Registry.
Access to the private registry is not given automatically upon purchase - you have to request it. You will then be issued
a special access key and secret for AWS ECR which you save as a new profile in your `~/.aws/credentials`. Then execute
the following BASH commands:
```
# authenticate docker with ECR using the temporary access token
$(aws --profile ScooldEcrProfile ecr get-login --no-include-email --region eu-west-1)
# list all tags
aws --profile ScooldEcrProfile ecr list-images --repository-name scoold-pro
# pull image with a specific tag
docker pull 374874639893.dkr.ecr.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/scoold-pro:{tag}
```

The `:latest` tag is not supported. The command `aws get-login` gives you an access token to the private Docker registry
which is valid for **12 hours**.

For connecting Kubernetes to AWS ECR, please refer to [this article](https://medium.com/@damitj07/how-to-configure-and-use-aws-ecr-with-kubernetes-rancher2-0-6144c626d42c).

In case you don't want to use AWS CLI for logging into the Scoold Pro registry, install the
[AWS ECR Docker Credentials Helper](https://github.com/awslabs/amazon-ecr-credential-helper).


## Deploying Scoold to Heroku

**One-click deployment**

[![Deploy](https://www.herokucdn.com/deploy/button.svg)](https://heroku.com/deploy?template=https://github.com/Erudika/scoold)

### Manual deployment - option 1 (code push)

1. First, clone this repository and create a new Heroku app
2. Add Heroku as a Git remote target and push your changes with `git push heroku master`
3. Go to the Heroku admin panel, under "Settings", "Reveal Config Vars" and set all the configuration variables shown
above but **replace all dots in the variable names with underscores**, e.g. `para.endpoint` -> `para_endpoint`.
4. Open the app in your browser at `https://{appname}.herokuapp.com`.

### Manual deployment - option 2 (JAR push)

1. Build the Scoold JAR file or acquire the Scoold Pro JAR package by [buying Pro](https://paraio.com/scoold-pro)
2. [Download and install the Heroku CLI](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-cli)
3. Create a Heroku app or use the id of an existing Heroku app where you want Scoold deployed
4. Add the `heroku/jvm` and `heroku/java` buildpacks to your Heroku app from the Settings page
5. Create a file `Procfile` containing this line:
```
web: java -Dserver.port=$PORT $JAVA_OPTS -jar scoold-*.jar $JAR_OPTS
```
6. Open a terminal in the directory containing the JAR file and execute:
```
$ heroku plugins:install java
$ heroku deploy:jar scoold-x.y.z.jar --app myscooldapp
```
Pushing JARs to Heroku is useful in cases where you have an existing Heroku app which hosts a free version of Scoold,
deployed through the "one-click" Heroku button, and you want to upgrade it to Scoold Pro.

### Configuring Scoold on Heroku

On Heroku you don't have a configuration file, instead you use Heroku's environment variables to configure Scoold.
You can add each Scoold configuration property as an environment variable on the Settings page of your Heroku admin page.
Click "Reveal Config Vars". Configuration variables (config vars) **must not** contain dots ".", for example `para.endpoint`
becomes `para_endpoint`. You **must** replace every dot with an underscore in order to convert a Scoold configuration
property to a Heroku environment variable.

It's also helpful to install the Heroku CLI tool. Using the CLI you can watch the Scoold logs with:
```
$ heroku logs --tail --app myscooldapp
```
Or you can restart your dyno with:
```
$ heroku restart --app myscooldapp
```

## Deploying Scoold to DigitalOcean

1. Create a droplet running Ubuntu and SSH into it
2. Create a user `ubuntu` with `adduser ubuntu`
3. Execute (as root) `wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Erudika/scoold/master/installer.sh && bash installer.sh`
4. Copy the configuration file to your droplet: `scp application.conf root@123.234.12.34:/home/ubuntu`
5. Restart Scoold with `ssh root@123.234.12.34 "systemctl restart scoold.service"`
6. Go to `http://123.234.12.34:8000` and verify that Scoold is running (use the correct IP address of your droplet)
7. Configure SSL on DigitalOcean or install nginx + letsencrypt on your droplet (see instructions below)

## Deploying Scoold to AWS

<a href="https://lightsail.aws.amazon.com/ls/webapp/create/instance" title="Deploy to Lightsail">
	<img src="https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/com.scoold.files/awsdeploy.svg" height="32" alt="deploy to aws button">
</a>

**Lightsail**

1. Click the button above
2. Choose "Linux", "OS only", "Ubuntu 18.04 LTS"
3. Click "+ Add launch script" and copy/paste the contents of [installer.sh](https://github.com/Erudika/scoold/blob/master/installer.sh)
4. Download the default SSH key pair or upload your own
5. Choose the 512MB instance or larger (1GB recommended)
6. Wait for the instance to start and open the IP address in your browser at port `8000`

**Elatic Beanstalk**

1. Clone this repo and change directory to it
2. Generate a WAR package with `mvn -Pwar package`
3. [Create a new Beanstalk web app](https://console.aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/home?region=eu-west-1#/newApplication?applicationName=Scoold&platform=Tomcat&tierName=WebServer&instanceType=t1.micro)
4. Upload the WAR package `target/scoold-x.y.z.war` to Beanstalk, modify any additional options and hit "Create"

**Authentication with Amazon Cognito**

Scoold is fully compatible with Amazon Cognito because Cognito is just another OAuth 2.0 service provider. Here's how to
configure Scoold to work with Amazon Cognito:

1. Create a Cognito user pool (if you don't have one already)
2. Create a Cognito App client with the OAuth 2.0 authorization code grant enabled:
3. Create a Cognito login subdomain for your app client like this: `https://scoold.auth.eu-west-1.amazoncognito.com`
4. Edit the Scoold configuration file `application.conf` and add a new OAuth 2.0 authentication provider:
```ini
para.oa2_app_id = "cognito_app_client_id"
para.oa2_secret = "cognito_app_client_secret"
para.security.oauth.authz_url = "https://scoold.auth.eu-west-1.amazoncognito.com/login"
para.security.oauth.token_url = "https://scoold.auth.eu-west-1.amazoncognito.com/oauth2/token"
para.security.oauth.profile_url = "https://scoold.auth.eu-west-1.amazoncognito.com/oauth2/userInfo"
para.security.oauth.provider = "Continue with Cognito"
```
5. Restart Scoold and login with a user from your Cognito user pool

## Deploying Scoold to Azure

[![Deploy to Azure](https://azuredeploy.net/deploybutton.svg)](https://deploy.azure.com/?repository=https://github.com/Erudika/scoold)

1. Click the button above
2. Fill in the required parameters
3. Launch the container
4. Go to your container and press "Connect" using `/bin/sh`
5. In the terminal type in `vi application.conf`, hit `i` and paste in your configuration
6. Hit `Esc` and type in `:wq` then restart your container
Another option is to attach a [secret volume](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/container-instances/container-instances-volume-secret)
to your container, containing the configuration. It should be mounted as `/scoold/application.conf`.

## Deploying Scoold to Google App Engine

1. Clone this repo and change directory to it
2. Create a project in the Google Cloud Platform Console
3. Install the Google Cloud SDK
4. Delete `Dockerfile` and `app.yml`
4. Edit `app.gae.yaml` to suit your needs
6. Deploy it with `gcloud preview app deploy app.gae.yaml`

## Deploying Scoold to a servlet container

The instructions for Tomcat in particular are:

1. Generate a WAR package with `mvn -Pwar package`
2. Rename the WAR package to `ROOT.war` if you want it deployed to the root context or leave it as is
3. Put the WAR package in `Tomcat/webapps/` & start Tomcat
4. Put `application.conf` in `Tomcat/webapps/scoold-folder/WEB-INF/classes/` & restart Tomcat

Scoold is compatible with Tomcat 9+.

## Deploying Scoold under a specific context path

To deploy Scoold at a different path instead of the root path, set `para.context_path = "/newpath`. The default value
for this setting is blank, meaning Scoold will be deployed at the root directory.

## Migrating from one Para deployment to another

There are situations where you want to transfer your data from one Para server to another. This may be because you
decided to switch databases or hosting providers. This process is made simple with the backup and restore feature in
Scoold and Scoold Pro. Simply go to the Administration page and download all your data from the source installation.
Then on the target installation go to the Administration page and import the ZIP file which contains the backup.

**Important:** All data will be overwritten on restore, so it's highly recommended that the target Scoold installation
is fresh and containing no data.

## Content-Security-Policy header

This header is enabled by default for enhanced security. It can be disabled with `para.csp_header_enabled = false`.
The default value is modified through `para.csp_header = "new_value"`. The default CSP header is:
```ini
default-src 'self';
base-uri 'self';
connect-src 'self' scoold.com www.google-analytics.com www.googletagmanager.com;
frame-src 'self' accounts.google.com staticxx.facebook.com;
font-src cdnjs.cloudflare.com fonts.gstatic.com fonts.googleapis.com;
style-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline' fonts.googleapis.com cdnjs.cloudflare.com static.scoold.com;
img-src 'self' https: data:;
object-src 'none;
report-uri /reports/cspv;
script-src 'unsafe-inline' https: 'nonce-{{nonce}}' 'strict-dynamic';
```

The placeholder `{{nonce}}` will get replaced by the CSP nonce value used for whitelisting scripts.

**Note:** If you get CSP violation errors, check your `para.host_url` and `para.cdn_url` configuration,
or edit the value of `para.csp_header`.

Additionally, there are 4 options to extend the values of `connect-src`, `frame-src`, `font-src` and `style-src`
respectively:
```ini
para.csp_connect_sources = "connect-domain1.com connect-domain2.com"
para.csp_frame_sources = "frame-domain1.com frame-domain2.com"
para.csp_font_sources = "font-domain1.com font-domain2.com"
para.csp_style_sources = "style-domain1.com style-domain2.com"
```

You can also enable or disable CSP violation reports (visible only to admins) by setting `para.csp_reports_enabled = true`.
Keep in mind that if your website has a lot of traffic, this will result in hundreds of new reports being created each hour.

## External scripts and JS snippets

You can append external scripts and JS snippets to the end of the page by setting the `para.external_scripts` property.
Scripts are loaded in alphabetical order based on their key.
```ini
# URL
para.external_scripts.myscript1 = "https://mydomain.com/script.js"
# Base64 encoded long JavaScript snippet
para.external_scripts.myscript2 = "J2Y2M3VlcH .... enZ2OScpOw=="
# Short raw JS snippet
para.external_scripts.myscript3 = "var x = 5; console.log('x is', x);"
```

**Important:** Watch out for console errors in the browser after you add external scripts. In such cases you might have to
modify the `frame-src` or `connect-src` portions of the CSP header (see the 4 options above).

If 3rd party cookie consent is enabled (for GDPR, CCPA), all external scripts will be disabled until the user gives their
consent. You can bypass that by prefixing its key with "bypassconsent", e.g. `para.external_scripts.bypassconsent_myscript2`.

## External CSS stylesheets

You can add external stylesheets to the website with `para.external_styles`.
```ini
para.external_styles = "https://mydomain.com/style1.css, https://mydomain.com/style2.css"
```

Additionally, you can inline short snippets of CSS using `para.inline_css`. Keep in mind that any inlined CSS rules will
override any of the previously declared stylesheets, including the main stylesheet rules.

## Serving static files from a CDN

Scoold will serve static files (JS, CSS, fonts) from the same domain where it is deployed. You can configure the
`para.cdn_url` to enable serving those files from a CDN. The value of the CDN URL *must not* end in "/".

## SMTP configuration

Scoold uses the JavaMail API to send emails. If you want Scoold to send notification emails you should add the
following SMTP settings to your config file:

```ini
# system email address
para.support_email = "support@scoold.com"

para.mail.host = "smtp.example.com"
para.mail.port = 587
para.mail.username = "user@example.com"
para.mail.password = "password"
para.mail.tls = true
para.mail.ssl = false

# enable SMTP debug logging
para.mail.debug = true
```
The email template is located in `src/main/resources/emails/notify.html`.

For **Gmail** you have to turn on "Less secure app access" in your Google account settings. There's no need to configure
`mail.tls` or `mail.ssl`, just set the `mail.host` to `smtp.gmail.com` and your Gmail email and password.

## Email verification

You can enable or disable the email verification step by setting `para.security.allow_unverified_emails = true`
(in Scoold's `application.conf`). By default, email verification is turned off when Scoold is running in development mode.
This will allow new users to register with fake emails and Scoold will not send them a confirmation email. It's useful
for testing purposes or in certain situations where you want to programmatically sign up users who don't have an email.

## Welcome email customization

To customize the message sent when a new user signs up with Scoold, modify these properties in your Scoold configuration
file:
```ini
para.emails.welcome_text1 = "You are now part of {0} - a friendly Q&A community..."
para.emails.welcome_text2 = "To get started, simply navigate to the "Ask question" page and ask a question..."
para.emails.welcome_text3 = "Best, <br>The {0} team<br><br>"
```

## Social login

For authenticating with Facebook or Google, you only need your Google client id
(e.g. `123-abcd.apps.googleusercontent.com`), or Facebook app id (only digits).
For all the other providers, GitHub, LinkedIn, Twitter, Slack and Microsoft, you need to set both the app id and secret key.
**Note:** if the credentials are blank, the sign in button is hidden for that provider.
```ini
# Facebook
para.fb_app_id = "123456789"
# Google
para.google_client_id = "123-abcd.apps.googleusercontent.com"
# GitHub
para.gh_app_id = ""
para.gh_secret = ""
# LinkedIn
para.in_app_id = ""
para.in_secret = ""
# Twitter
para.tw_app_id = ""
para.tw_secret = ""
# Microsoft
para.ms_app_id = ""
para.ms_secret = ""
# Slack
para.sl_app_id = ""
para.sl_secret = ""
```
You also need to set your host URL when running Scoold in production:
```ini
para.host_url = "https://your.scoold.url"
```
This is required for authentication requests to be redirected back to the origin.

**Important:** You must to whitelist the [Para endpoints](https://paraio.org/docs/#031-github) in the admin consoles of
each authentication provider. For example, for GitHub you need to whitelist `https://parahost.com/github_auth` as a
callback URL (redirect URL). Same thing applies for the other providers, **except Facebook and Google**.
For these two providers you need to whitelist these two URLs, containing the public address of Scoold:
```
https://myscoold.com
https://myscoold.com/signin
```
For locally hosted authentication providers (SAML, LDAP, Mattermost, etc.) the authentication endpoints will also be
pointing to the URL of your Scoold server.

**If you skip this step, authentication will most likely not work.**

## OAuth 2.0 login

You can authenticate users against any OAuth 2.0/OpenID Connect server through the generic OAuth 2 filter in Para.
Here are all the options which you can set in the Scoold configuration file:
```ini
# minimal setup
para.oa2_app_id = ""
para.oa2_secret = ""
para.security.oauth.authz_url = "https://your-idp.com/login"
para.security.oauth.token_url = "https://your-idp.com/token"
para.security.oauth.profile_url = "https://your-idp.com/userinfo"
para.security.oauth.scope = "openid email profile"

# extra options
para.security.oauth.accept_header = ""
para.security.oauth.domain = "paraio.com"
para.security.oauth.parameters.id = "sub"
para.security.oauth.parameters.picture = "picture"
para.security.oauth.parameters.email = "email"
para.security.oauth.parameters.name = "name"

# Sets the string on the login button
para.security.oauth.provider = "Continue with OpenID Connect"

# Enable/disable access token delegation
para.security.oauth.token_delegation_enabled = false
```

**Access token delegation** is an additional security feature, where the access token from the identity provider (IDP)
is stored in the user's `idpAccessToken` field and validated on each authentication request with the IDP. If the IDP
revokes a delegated access token, then that user would automatically be logged out from Scoold and denied access
immediately.

You can add two additional custom OAuth 2.0/OpenID connect providers called "second" and "third". Here's what the settings
look like for the "second" provider:

```ini
# minimal setup (second provider)
para.oa2second_app_id = ""
para.oa2second_secret = ""
para.security.oauthsecond.authz_url = "https://your-idp.com/login"
para.security.oauthsecond.token_url = "https://your-idp.com/token"
para.security.oauthsecond.profile_url = "https://your-idp.com/userinfo"
para.security.oauthsecond.scope = "openid email profile"

# extra options (second provider)
para.security.oauthsecond.accept_header = ""
para.security.oauthsecond.domain = "paraio.com"
para.security.oauthsecond.parameters.id = "sub"
para.security.oauthsecond.parameters.picture = "picture"
para.security.oauthsecond.parameters.email = "email"
para.security.oauthsecond.parameters.name = "name"

# Sets the string on the login button (second provider)
para.security.oauthsecond.provider = "Continue with Second OAuth 2.0 provider"

# Enable/disable access token delegation (second provider)
para.security.oauthsecond.token_delegation_enabled = false
```

For the "third" OAuth 2.0 provider it's the same configuration but replace "second" with "third".

## LDAP configuration

LDAP authentication is initiated with a request like this `POST /signin?provider=ldap&access_token=username:password`.
There are several configuration options which Para needs in order to connect to your LDAP server. These are the defaults:

```ini
# minimal setup
para.security.ldap.server_url = "ldap://localhost:8389/"
para.security.ldap.base_dn = "dc=springframework,dc=org"
para.security.ldap.user_dn_pattern = "uid={0}"
# add this ONLY if you are connecting to Active Directory
para.security.ldap.active_directory_domain = ""

# extra options - change only if necessary
para.security.ldap.user_search_base = ""
para.security.ldap.user_search_filter = "(cn={0})"
para.security.ldap.password_attribute = "userPassword"
para.security.ldap.username_as_name = false

# Sets the string on the login button (PRO)
para.security.ldap.provider = "Continue with LDAP"
```

The search filter syntax allows you to use the placeholder `{0}` which gets replaced with the person's username.

### Active Directory LDAP

For **Active Directory** LDAP, the search filter defaults to `(&(objectClass=user)(userPrincipalName={0}))`.
A good alternative search filter would be `(&(objectClass=user)(sAMAccountName={1}))`. Keep in mind that the domain you
put in the configuration is actually the UPN suffix which gets appended to the username as `username@domain.com` if
the supplied login username doesn't end with a domain. The domain has nothing to do with the AD domain or the location
of the AD server.

The only valid configuration properties for AD are:
`user_search_filter`, `base_dn`, `server_url` and `active_directory_domain` - everything else is ignored so don't put
it in the config file at all!

Here's a working LDAP configuration for AD:
```ini
para.security.ldap.user_search_filter = "(&(objectClass=user)(sAMAccountName={1}))"
para.security.ldap.base_dn = "ou=dev,dc=scoold,dc=com"
para.security.ldap.server_url = "ldap://192.168.123.70:389"
para.security.ldap.active_directory_domain = "scoold.com"
```

For the above configuration the following logins should work, given that a user `joe` exists:
- `joe@scoold.com` + password
- `joe@some-other-domain.com` + password
- `joe` + password

As you can see the domain part is actually ignored because it is irrelevant. You cannot bind an AD user with their email.
You can bind them based on their `username` a.k.a. `sAMAccountName`. If the user has an email address where the alias is
the same as the `sAMAccountName` but the domain is different, then the login will succeed. If the user above has an email
`joe.smith@gmail.com` then the login with that email will fail because a bind is not possible,
and the LDAP search request will return no results.

The syntax for the search filter allows you to use the placeholders `{0}` (replaced with `username@domain`) and `{1}`
(replaced with `username` only).

Here's an example **Active Directory** configuration (note that any other settings than the ones below will be ignored):
```ini
para.security.ldap.server_url = "ldap://server:389"
para.security.ldap.active_directory_domain = "domain.com"
para.security.ldap.user_search_filter = "userPrincipalName={0}"
para.security.ldap.base_dn = "ou=dev,dc=domain,dc=com"
```

### Local (internal) LDAP authentication

**PRO** Scoold Pro can authenticate users with an internal (local) LDAP server, even if your Para backend is hosted outside
of your network (like ParaIO.com). This adds an extra layer of security and flexibility and doesn't require a publicly
accessible LDAP server. To enable this feature, add this to your configuration:
```
para.security.ldap.is_local = true
# required for passwordless authentication with Para
para.app_secret_key = "change_to_long_random_string"
```
Note that the secret key above is **not** the same as your Para secret key! You have to generate a random string for that
(min. 32 chars).

To print out debug information about LDAP requests, start Para with `-Dlogging.level.org.springframework.ldap=DEBUG`.
If you are connecting to an internal LDAP server, add the same system property to the Scoold command line.

Please, read the [LDAP docs for Para](https://paraio.org/docs/#030-ldap) to learn more about the settings above.

## SAML configuration

**PRO**
First, you have to setup Para as a SAML service provider using the config below. Then you can exchange SAML metadata with
your SAML identity provider (IDP). The SP metadata endpoint is `/saml_metadata/{appid}`. For example, if your Para
endpoint is `paraio.com` and your `appid` is `scoold`, then the metadata is available at
`https://paraio.com/saml_metadata/scoold`.

SAML authentication is initiated by sending users to the Para SAML authentication endpoint `/saml_auth/{appid}`.
For example, if your Para endpoint is `paraio.com` and your `appid` is `scoold`, then the user should be sent to
`https://paraio.com/saml_auth/scoold`. Para (the service provider) will handle the request and redirect to the SAML IDP.
Finally, upon successful authentication, the user is redirected back to `https://paraio.com/saml_auth/scoold` which is
also the assertion consumer service (ACS).

**Note:** The X509 certificate and private key must be encoded as Base64 in the configuration file. Additionally,
the private key must be in the **PKCS#8 format** (`---BEGIN PRIVATE KEY---`). To convert from PKCS#1 to PKCS#8, use this:
```
openssl pkcs8 -topk8 -inform pem -nocrypt -in sp.rsa_key -outform pem -out sp.pem
```

There are lots of configuration options but Para needs only a few of those in order to successfully
authenticate with your SAML IDP (listed in the first rows below).

```ini
# minimal setup
# IDP metadata URL, e.g. https://idphost/idp/shibboleth
para.security.saml.idp.metadata_url = ""

# SP endpoint, e.g. https://paraio.com/saml_auth/scoold
para.security.saml.sp.entityid = ""

# SP public key as Base64(x509 certificate)
para.security.saml.sp.x509cert = ""

# SP private key as Base64(PKCS#8 key)
para.security.saml.sp.privatekey = ""

# attribute mappings (usually required)
# e.g. urn:oid:0.9.2342.19200300.100.1.1
para.security.saml.attributes.id = ""
# e.g. urn:oid:0.9.2342.19200300.100.1.3
para.security.saml.attributes.email = ""
# e.g. urn:oid:2.5.4.3
para.security.saml.attributes.name = ""


# extra options (optional)
# this is usually the same as the "EntityId"
para.security.saml.sp.assertion_consumer_service.url = ""
para.security.saml.sp.nameidformat = ""

# IDP metadata is usually automatically fetched
para.security.saml.idp.entityid = ""
para.security.saml.idp.single_sign_on_service.url = ""
para.security.saml.idp.x509cert = ""

para.security.saml.security.authnrequest_signed = false
para.security.saml.security.want_messages_signed = false
para.security.saml.security.want_assertions_signed = false
para.security.saml.security.want_assertions_encrypted = false
para.security.saml.security.want_nameid_encrypted = false
para.security.saml.security.sign_metadata = false
para.security.saml.security.want_xml_validation = true
para.security.saml.security.signature_algorithm = ""

para.security.saml.attributes.firstname = ""
para.security.saml.attributes.picture = ""
para.security.saml.attributes.lastname = ""
para.security.saml.domain = "paraio.com"

# Sets the string on the login button
para.security.saml.provider = "Continue with SAML"
```

Scoold Pro can authenticate users with an internal (local) SAML provider, even if your Para backend is hosted outside of
your network (like ParaIO.com). This adds an extra layer of security and flexibility and doesn't require your SAML
endpoints to be publicly accessible. To enable this feature, add this to your configuration:
```
para.security.saml.is_local = true
# required for passwordless authentication with Para
para.app_secret_key = "change_to_long_random_string"
```
Note that the secret key above is **not** the same as your Para secret key! You have to generate a random string for that
(min. 32 chars).

## Custom authentication (Single Sign-on)

**PRO**
Para supports custom authentication providers through its "passwordless" filter. This means that you can send any
user info to Para and it will authenticate that user automatically without passwords. The only verification done here is
on this secret key value which you provide in your Scoold Pro configuration file:
```
para.app_secret_key = "change_to_long_random_string"
```
This key is used to protect requests to the passwordless filter and it's different from the Para secret key for your app.
Here's the basic authentication flow:

1. A user wants to sign in to Scoold Pro and clicks a button
2. The button redirects the user to a remote login page you or your company set up.
3. The user enters their credentials and logs in.
4. If the credentials are valid, you send back a special JSON Web Token (JWT) to Scoold with the user's basic information.
5. Scoold verifies the token and the user is signed in to Scoold

The JWT must contain the following claims:

- `email` - user's email address
- `name` - user's display name
- `identifier` - a unique user id in the format `custom:123`
- `appid` - the app id (optional)

The JWT is signed with the value of `para.app_secret_key` and should have a short validity period (e.g. 10 min).
The JWT should also contain the claims `iat` and `exp` and, optionally, `nbf`. Supported signature algorithms for the JWT
are `HS256`, `HS384` or `HS512`.
Once you generate the JWT on your backend (step 4 above), redirect the successful login request back to Scoold:
```
GET https://scoold-host/signin/success?jwt=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiI..&passwordless=true
```

The UI button initiating the authentication flow above can be customized like this:
```
para.security.custom.provider = "Continue with Acme Co."
# location of your company's login page
para.security.custom.login_url = ""
```

There's an [example login page](https://albogdano.github.io/scoold-login-page/) implementing this sort of authentication.

## Spaces (a.k.a. Teams)

Spaces are a way to organize users and questions into isolated groups. There's a default space, which is publicly
accessible by default. Each user can belong to one or more spaces, but a question can only belong to a single space.
Permission to access a space is given by an administrator. You can bulk edit users' spaces and also move a question to a
different space.

By default there's a public "default" space where all questions go. When you create a new space and assign users to it
they will still see all the other questions when they switch to the "default" space. To make the default space private
set `para.is_default_space_public = false`.

**PRO** In Scoold PRO you can create as many space as you need. The open source version is limited to 10 spaces. Also
in PRO you can automatically assign multiple spaces to new users, whereas in the OSS version you can only assign one.

If you want to assign space(s) to new users automatically, add this to your configuration:
```
# put space ids here, the "scooldspace:" prefix is optional
para.auto_assign_spaces = "my-space-one,my-other-space"
```

Alternatively, Scoold Pro can have spaces delegated to users from an OpenID Connect/OAuth 2.0 identity provider.
You have to enable access token delegation with `para.security.oauth.token_delegation_enabled = true` and Scoold will
try to obtain spaces from a custom attribute like `spaces`. Such custom attributes can be configured in the IDP and
pushed to clients (Scoold) embedded in access tokens. If you want to change the name of the custom attribute supplied
by your IDP, set `para.security.oauth.spaces_attribute_name`, which by default is equal to `spaces`. The value of that
attribute should contain comma-separated list of spaces. If the spaces pushed from the IDP do not exist, Scoold will
create them for you.

## Webhooks

Webhooks are enabled by default in Scoold. To disable this functionality set `para.webhooks_enabled = false`. If you
are self-hosting Para, you need to also enable webhooks there using the same configuration option.
You can add/remove webhooks in the "Administration" page.

For more details about webhooks, please read the [Para docs on webhooks](https://paraio.org/docs/#011-webhooks).

## Domain-restricted user registrations

You can restrict signups only to users from a particular identity domain, say `acme-corp.com`. To do so, set the
following configuration property:
```
para.approved_domains_for_signups = "acme-corp.com"
```
Then a user with email `john@acme-corp.com` will be allowed to login (the identity provider is irrelevant), but user
`bob@gmail.com` will be denied access.

**PRO** In Scoold PRO this setting can also contain a comma-separated list of identity domains:
```
para.approved_domains_for_signups = "acme-corp.com,gmail.com"
```

## Admins

You can specify the user with administrative privileges in your `application.conf` file:
```
para.admins = "joe@example.com"
```
**PRO** In Scoold PRO you can have multiple admin users by specifying a comma-separated list of user identifiers.
This works both for new and existing users.
```
para.admins = "joe@example.com,fb:1023405345366,gh:1234124"
```

If you remove users who are already admins from the list of admins `para.admins`, they will be *demoted* to regular
users. Similarly, existing regular users will be *promoted* to admins if they appear in the list above.

## Anonymous posts

**PRO**
This feature is enabled with `para.anonymous_posts_enabled = true`. It allows everyone to ask questions and write
replies, without having a Scoold account. Posting to the "Feedback" section will also be open without requiring users
to sign in. This feature is disabled by default.

Additionally, people may wish to make their profile details anonymous from the Settings page. To allow this option set:
```
para.profile_anonimity_enabled = true
```

## Enabling the "Feedback" section

You can enable or disable the "Feedback" page where people can discuss topics about the website itself or submit general
feedback. This section is disabled by default and can be activated with `para.feedback_enabled = true`.

## LaTeX/MathML support and advanced highlighting

**PRO**
You can enable this feature by setting `para.mathjax_enabled = true`. Then you can use MathML expressions by surrounding
them with `$$` signs, e.g. `$$ \frac {1}{2} $$` By default, MathJax is disabled.

The Prism syntax highlighter is included and it supports many different languages. You need to specify the language for
each code block if you want the highlighting to be more accurate (see [all supported languages](https://prismjs.com/#languages-list)).
For example:

    ```csharp
    var dict = new Dictionary<string>();
    ```

## Image uploads

**PRO**
Images can be uploaded to the local file system or Imgur. If you set the Imgur client id, Imgur is automatically selected
as the storage service. To use Imgur for file storage, specify your Imgur API client id:
```
para.imgur_client_id = "x23e8t0askdj"
```

Local file storage is used by default. To configure the directory on the server where files will be stored, set:
```
para.file_uploads_dir = "uploads"
```

To upload an image just **drag & drop** the file you want to upload onto the post editor. A link will automatically appear
when the upload is finished.

Profile pictures (avatars) can also be changed by dragging a new image on top of the existing profile picture on a
user's `/profile` page. For best results, use a square image here.

In the future, more upload services could be supported such as S3.

## Slack integration

Scoold **PRO** integrates with Slack on a number of levels. First, Scoold users can sign in with Slack. They can also
use slash commands to search and post questions. Also Scoold can notify Slack users when they are mentioned on Scoold.
Finally, Scoold allows you to map spaces to Slack workspaces or channels. By default, each Slack workspace (team) is
mapped to a single Scoold space when people sign in with Slack.

**Important:** Most of the Slack operations require a **valid Slack ID stored in Scoold** which enables the mapping of
Slack users to Scoold accounts and vice versa. Slack IDs are set automatically when a Scoold user signs in with Slack.

The integration endpoint for Slack is `/slack` - this is where Scoold will accept and process requests from Slack.
To enable the Slack integration you need to register for a Slack app first and set `para.sl_app_id` and `para.sl_secret`.
Follow the [detailed instructions here](https://scoold.com/slack.html).

Here are the configuration properties for Slack:
```
para.slack.app_id = "SHORT_APPID"
para.slack.map_workspaces_to_spaces = true
para.slack.map_channels_to_spaces = false
para.slack.post_to_space = "workspace|scooldspace:myspace|default"

para.slack.notify_on_new_question = true
para.slack.notify_on_new_answer = true
para.slack.default_question_tags = "via-mattermost"
```

Setting `para.slack.map_channels_to_spaces` will ask for additional permissions, namely `channels:read` and `groups:read`.
On sign in, Scoold will read all your channels and create spaces from them. The workspace space is always created if
`para.slack.map_workspaces_to_spaces = true`, which is the default setting.

When creating quesitons from Slack they are posted to the channel workspace by default, if
`para.slack.map_channels_to_spaces` is enabled. For example, in this case, for a team "My Team" and channel "chan",
your space will become "My Team #chan". This is controlled by `para.slack.post_to_space` which is blank by default.
If you set it to `workspace`, then questions will be posted to the "My Team" space. Or you could set a specific Scoold
space to post to with `para.slack.post_to_space = "scooldspace:myspace"`. If the value is `default` then all questions
posted from Slack will go to the default space.

You can also create answers to questions from Slack, either from the message action button or by typing in the
`/scoold ask` command. This requires the URL of a specific question you wish to answer.

### Slack notifications

Scoold will notify the channels where you have it installed, whenever a new question or answer is created. To install
the application on multiple channels go to the Administration page and click the "Add to Slack" button for each channel.
You can receive notification on up to 10 channels simultaneously. Notification for new posts will go to the channel
associated with the space in which the post was created. For example if `para.slack.map_workspaces_to_spaces` is `true`,
and a question is created in space "Team1 #general", Scoold will search for webhook registrations matching that
team/channel combination and send a notification there. Direct message webhooks will be used only if there's no
space-matching channel found.

### Approving new posts from Slack

This works if you have enabled `para.posts_need_approval`. When a new question or answer is created by a user with less
reputation than the threshold, a notification message will be sent to Slack, giving you the option to either approve or
delete that post. The action can only be performed by moderators.

### Slash commands

Typing in `/scoold help` gives you a list of commands available:

- `/scoold` - Interact with your Scoold server
- `/scoold ask [text]` Ask a question directly, first sentence becomes the title. Example: `/scoold ask How does this work? @john I'm having troubles with...`
- `/scoold answer [question URL] [answer]` Answer a question directly. Example: `/scoold answer https://host/question/123 This is my answer to your question, @john.`
- `/scoold search [query]` Search for questions. Example: `/scoold search solution AND quick*`
- `/scoold search-people [query]` Search for people. Example: `/scoold search-people John*`
- `/scoold search-tags [query]` Search for tags. Example: `/scoold search-tags solution*`
- `/scoold version` Get version information for Scoold and Para.
- `/scoold whoami` Get information for your Scoold account.
- `/scoold stats` Get general statistics.

### Message actions

Here are the interactive message actions which are currently implemented:
- `create_question` - "Ask on Scoold", Creates a new question on Scoold directly from a chat message.
- `create_question_dialog` - "Edit & ask on Scoold", Opens up a dialog to edit question before posting.
- `create_answer_dialog` - "Answer on Scoold", Opens up a dialog to edit your answer before posting.

These allow you to perform actions from any channel and best of all, these can turn any chat message into a question or
answer.

If you get an error **"User not authorised to open dialogs"** it means that your Scoold user is not logged in via Slack
and Scoold doesn't have a Slack access token on record. Simply log into Scoold with Slack and the error should go away.

## Mattermost integration

Scoold **PRO** also integrates with Mattermost. Scoold users can sign in with Mattermost, use slash commands to interact
with Scoold and also get in-chat notification for mentions and new posts on Scoold. Scoold allows you to map spaces to
Mattermost teams or channels. By default, each Mattermost team is mapped to a single Scoold space when people sign in
with Mattermost.

**Important:** Most of the Mattermost operations require a **valid Mattermost ID stored in Scoold** which enables the
mapping of Mattermost users to Scoold accounts and vice versa. Mattermost IDs are set automatically when a Scoold user
signs in with Mattermost.

The integration endpoint for Mattermost is `/mattermost` - this is where Scoold will accept and process requests from
Mattermost. To enable the Mattermost integration you need to enable OAuth 2.0 apps and create one in Mattermost's System
Console. Then set `para.mm_app_id` and `para.mm_secret`. Follow the [detailed instructions here](https://scoold.com/mattermost.html).

Here are the configuration properties for Mattermost:
```
para.mattermost.server_url = "http://localhost:8065"
para.mattermost.bot_username = "scoold"
para.mattermost.bot_icon_url = "http://localhost:8000/images/logowhite.png"
para.mattermost.map_workspaces_to_spaces = true
para.mattermost.map_channels_to_spaces = false
para.mattermost.post_to_space = "workspace|scooldspace:myspace|default"

para.mattermost.notify_on_new_question = true
para.mattermost.notify_on_new_answer = true
para.mattermost.default_question_tags = "via-mattermost"
```

**Note:** Mattermost does not support message actions like in Slack. This means that you can't create a question from
a any chat message. The reply dialog box can be opened from a "Reply" button under each question notification message or
via the `/scoold answer-form` command.
The dialog box for new questions is opened via the new slash command `/scoold ask-form`.

All the other slash commands and notifications work just like with Slack and are described above. The Mattermost
integration will automatically create a slash command for each channel linked to Scoold on the admin page.

## Self-hosting Para and Scoold through SSL

The recommended way for enabling HTTPS with your own SSL certificate in a self-hosted environment is to run a
reverse-proxy server like NGINX in front of Scoold. As an alternative you can use Apache or Lighttpd.

1. Start Para on port `:8080`
2. Start Scoold on port `:8000`
3. Start NGINX with the configuration below

<details><summary><b>Example configuration for NGINX</b></summary>

## Securing Scoold with SSL using Nginx and Certbot (Let's Encrypt)

First of all, configure the DNS records for your domain to point to the IP address where Scoold is hosted.

1. SSH into your Ubuntu server and install Nginx and Certbot
```
sudo apt-get install nginx certbot python-certbot-nginx
```
2. Get a certificate and autoconfigure nginx to use it
```
sudo certbot --nginx
```
3. Turn on the Ubuntu firewall to block port `8000` and only allow ports `80` and `443`.
```
ufw allow 'Nginx Full' && sudo ufw enable
```
4. Configure nginx to forward requests from the web on ports `80` and `443` to `localhost:8000`
```
location / {
	proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:8000;
	proxy_redirect http:// $scheme://;
	proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
	proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
	proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto https;
	proxy_set_header Host $http_host;
}
```

That's it! If the Certbot validation above fails, your DNS is not configured properly or you have conflicting firewall rules.
Refer to [this article](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-secure-nginx-with-let-s-encrypt-on-ubuntu-18-04)
for more details.

## Periodic summary emails (email digest)

**PRO**
You can choose to enable periodic summary emails for all users in Scoold or allow them to opt-in for these messages.
By default summary emails are disabled and users can unsubscribe if they are enabled by admins.
A summary email contains all new questions for a past period of time (daily, weekly). Admins can enable summary emails
for everyone from the Settings page if `para.summary_email_controlled_by_admins = true`. If that parameter is `false`
each person (by default) controls whether they want to receive summary emails or not.

The period for which a summary report is generated is controlled by:
```
para.summary_email_period_days = 2
```
The values of this setting can range from `1` to `30` days, where `2` means "every other day", `7` means "every week".
The summary email contains a list of the top 25 recent questions. For more questions set `para.summary_email_items = 30`.

## Mentions

**PRO**
In Scoold Pro you can mention anyone in a question, answer or comment with `@Name`. A popup menu will appear once you
start typing after `@` giving you a list of names to choose from. The selected user will be mentioned with a special
mention tag in the form of `@<userID|John Doe>`. You can edit the name part of that tag (after `|`) but nothing else,
if you want the mention to work. You can mention up to 10 people in a post.

Users can opt-in to receive email notifications when they are mentioned or that can be switched on/off by admins.
For the latter option set:
```
para.mention_emails_controlled_by_admins = true
```

## Security headers

Scoold attaches several security headers to each response. These can be enabled or disabled with the following configuration
properties:

```
# Strict-Transport-Security
para.hsts_header_enabled = true

# X-Frame-Options
para.framing_header_enabled = true

# X-XSS-Protection
para.xss_header_enabled = true

# X-Content-Type-Options
para.contenttype_header_enabled = true

# Referrer-Policy
para.referrer_header_enabled = true
```

## Voting

By default, votes expire after a certain period, meaning the same user can vote again on the same post
(after 30 days by default). Votes can also be amended within a certain number of seconds (30s by default).
There are two configurable parameters which allow you to modify the length of those periods:
```
para.vote_locked_after_sec = 30
para.vote_expires_after_sec = 2592000
```

## Customizing the UI

There are a number of settings that let you customize the appearance of the website without changing the code.
```ini
para.fixed_nav = false
para.show_branding = true
para.logo_url = "/logo.svg"
para.logo_width = 90

# favicon image location
para.favicon_url = "/favicon.ico"
# overwrite the main stylesheet with your own
para.stylesheet_url = "/style.css"
# appends extra CSS rules to the main stylesheet
para.inline_css = ""
# edit the links in the footer of transactional emails
para.emails_footer_html = ""
# change the logo in transactional emails
para.small_logo_url = "https://scoold.com/logo.png"
```

In Scoold Pro you can change the logo of the website just by dragging and dropping a new image of your choice.

If you wish to add just a few simple CSS rules to the `<head>` element, instead of replacing the whole stylesheet,
simply add them as inline CSS:
```ini
para.inline_css = ".scoold-logo: { width: 100px; }"
```

You can set a short welcome message for unauthenticated users which will be displayed on the top of the page:
```ini
para.welcome_message = "Hello and welcome to Scoold!"
```

Alternatively, clone this repository and edit the files you want:

- **HTML** templates are in `src/main/resources/templates/`
- **CSS** stylesheets can be found in `src/main/resources/static/styles/`
- **JavaScript** files can be found in `src/main/resources/static/scripts/`
- **Images** are in located in `src/main/resources/static/images/`
- **Themes** are in located in `src/main/resources/themes/`

Also, please refer to the documentation for Spring Boot and Spring MVC.

## Third party cookie consent

Some countries have laws that require explicit cookie consent (e.g. GDPR, CCPA). Scoold can be integrated with Osano's
cookie consent script to enable the consent popup for compliance with those laws. Here's the configuration which enables
cookie consent:
```ini
para.cookie_consent_required = true
para.external_styles = "https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/cookieconsent@3/build/cookieconsent.min.css"
para.external_scripts.bypassconsent1 = "https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/cookieconsent@3/build/cookieconsent.min.js"
para.external_scripts.bypassconsent2 = "d2luZG93LmNvb2tpZWNvbnNlbnQuaW5pdGlhbGlzZSh7CiAgInBhbGV0dGUiOiB7CiAgICAicG9wdXAiOiB7CiAgICAgICJiYWNrZ3JvdW5kIjogIiM0NDQ0NDQiCiAgICB9LAogICAgImJ1dHRvbiI6IHsKICAgICAgImJhY2tncm91bmQiOiAiIzc3Nzc3NyIKICAgIH0KICB9LAogICJ0aGVtZSI6ICJjbGFzc2ljIiwKICAicG9zaXRpb24iOiAiYm90dG9tLWxlZnQiLAogICJ0eXBlIjogIm9wdC1pbiIsCiAgIm9uU3RhdHVzQ2hhbmdlIjogZnVuY3Rpb24ocyl7bG9jYXRpb24ucmVsb2FkKCk7fQp9KTs="
```
That last snippet of code is the Base64-encoded initialization of the cookie consent script:
```js
window.cookieconsent.initialise({
  "palette": {
    "popup": {
      "background": "#444444"
    },
    "button": {
      "background": "#777777"
    }
  },
  "theme": "classic",
  "position": "bottom-left",
  "type": "opt-in",
  "onStatusChange": function(s){location.reload();}
});
```
You can customize the above snippet however you like from [Osano's download page (Start coding link)](https://www.osano.com/cookieconsent/download/).
After you customize the snippet, it is important that you add `"onStatusChange": function(s){location.reload();}` at the end.

**Enabling cookie consent will automatically disable all external scripts and Google Analytics,
until the user gives their explicit consent.**

Note: Any other script can be used instead, as long as it set a cookie `cookieconsent_status = "allow"`.

## Translating Scoold

You can translate Scoold to your language by copying the [English language file](https://github.com/Erudika/scoold/blob/master/src/main/resources/lang_en.properties)
and translating it. When you're done, change the file name from "lang_en.properties" to "lang_xx.properties"
where "xx" is the language code for your locale. Finally, open a pull request here.

You can also change the default language of Scoold for all users by setting `para.default_language_code = "en"`, where
instead of "en" you enter the 2-letter code of the language of your choice.

## Scoold API

**The REST API is a work in progress.** The API can be accessed from `/api` and the Swagger documentation and console
are located at `/api.html`.

You can use the public endpoint `/api` to check the health of the server. A `GET /api` will return `200` if the server
is healthy and connected to Para, otherwise status code `500` is returned. The response body is similar to this:
```
{
  "healthy": true,
  "message": "Scoold API, see docs at http://localhost:8000/api.html"
}
```

## Building Scoold

To compile it you'll need JDK 8+ and Maven. Once you have it, just clone and build:

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/erudika/scoold.git && cd scoold
$ mvn install
```
To run a local instance of Scoold for development, use:
```sh
$ mvn -Dconfig.file=./application.conf spring-boot:run
```

To generate a WAR package, run:
```sh
$ mvn -Pwar package
```
